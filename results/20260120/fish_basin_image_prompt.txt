**SECTION 1: THE RISING TIDE (Bullish - Above SMA20)**

**Visual**: A magnificent golden koi fish pond with several fish **LEAPING UPWARD** out of the water, catching sunlight. The fish are stylized, elegant, and glowing.

The water should have a warm golden-red glow. Ripples emanating outward.

**SECTION 2: THE DEPTHS (Bearish - Below SMA20)**

**Visual**: At the bottom of the pond, in darker, cooler blue-green water, some fish are **SINKING** or **RESTING** on the bottom. They appear tired or dormant.

**Labels on Sinking Fish (Indices)**:
- 创业板指 (-0.30%)
- 上证50 (-0.36%)

The bottom should have a cooler, darker tone with subtle shadows.

**LAYOUT**:

- Clear visual separation between rising (top 60%) and depths (bottom 40%)

(Optimized for Nano Banana Pro3: Focus on the contrast between the leaping golden koi and the resting fish in the depths.)
